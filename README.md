This is a e-commerce platform created in react as part of a hackathon friday at School of Code. We got the design pretty close to the example we were given but ran out of time to add the final touches. We also didn't get time to add items to the cart but we did get the API loading and the filter function working. Shout out to my team mates Mo & Kunle!! ðŸ˜„

This was the ecommerce platform we had to attempt to recreate for our hackathon challenge using this API https://fakestoreapi.com/.

This is a demo of the app we managed to complete by the end of day.
